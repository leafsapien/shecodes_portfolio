## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [X] At least one profile picture
- [X] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [X] Your Preferred contact method (Github & Linkedin)
- [X] "Projects" section
- [X] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
I included 2 web pages, the main being the index and the secondary being the Projects page.  I included comments to detail each change in order to control each version pushed/committed to Git.  I deployed the website to GitHub pages using the main branch.  I implemented responsive design principles by ensuring the flexbox adapted to different sized screens.  I used semantic HTML by utilising the "alt" text for all images as well as defining the sectioning of the HTML e.g. head, header, body, main etc. in order to assist screen readers.

- [X] At least 2 web pages.
- [X] Version controlled with Git

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
I included a hover state for the top menu selection bar "Home/Projects" as well as different display states depending on which page you are viewing from.  I also added a hover state image change to my profile image (flips on hover) and the Projects page image (border glows on hover).

- [X] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
